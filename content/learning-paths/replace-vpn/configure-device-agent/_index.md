# Configure the device agent

The Cloudflare WARP client (known as the Cloudflare One Agent in mobile app stores) encrypts designated traffic from a user's device to Cloudflare's global network.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define which users can connect devices to your Zero Trust instance.
- Configure global and device-specific settings for the WARP client.
- Route user traffic through Cloudflare Gateway.
- Route domains to a private DNS server, if required.
